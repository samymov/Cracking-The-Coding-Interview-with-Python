Used for optimization problems to maximize or minimize something.

There are multiple solutions available.
The "feasible solutions" are the ones that satisfy the constraints.
But there is only one optimal solution.

Strategies for optimization problems:
1. Greedy Approach
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Branch and Bond
